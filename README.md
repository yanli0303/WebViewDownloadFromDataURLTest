# WebViewDownloadFromDataURLTest

It seems on macOS Catalina, you can't download files in [WebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/webview). This is a Xcode 11.2 project for testing it.

There are two test cases in this project:
- Download file from a [Data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).
- Download file from a relative URI.
